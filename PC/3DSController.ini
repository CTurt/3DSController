Default port is 8889, if you change this, you must change it in the 3DS's 3DSController.ini as well,

Circle Pad and Touch can be either JOYSTICK or MOUSE,

Mouse Speed controls how fast the Circle Pad or Touch Screen moves the mouse. If set to 0 and using the Touch Screen, it will set to the absolute position, rather than moving relatively to last position,

Buttons can be a letter for a keyboard key (like Q, W, E, R, T, or Y), a special keyboard key (like SPACE, CLICK, RIGHT CLICK, ENTER, BACKSPACE, SHIFT, TAB, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, or WINDOWS), or a joypad button (JOY1, JOY2, JOY3, to JOY8),

Alternatively, you can disable a key by binding it to NONE,

Throttle controls the delay between checking for new packets (in milliseconds), a high number will have slightly more lag between pressing a button on the 3DS and receiving it on the PC, however will make the application use less CPU. In my experience, 20 is a reasonable throttling amount,

Make sure to use a single space, not a tab for seperating settings,
