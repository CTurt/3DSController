Default port is 8889, if you change this, you must change it in the 3DS's 3DSController.ini as well,

Circle Pad, C Stick and Touch can be MOUSE, JOYSTICK1 or JOYSTICK2
JOYSTICK1 uses X and Y. JOYSTICK2 uses Rx and Ry. These are 0, 1, 3 and 4 respectively, leaving 2 and 5 unused.
Circle Pad and C Stick may also be set to KEYS, which will enable Pad directions to map to regular keys (no vJoy necessary).

Mouse Speed controls how fast the Circle Pad or Touch Screen moves the mouse. If set to 0 and using the Touch Screen, it will set to the absolute position, rather than moving relatively to last position,

Buttons can be a letter for a keyboard key (like Q, W, E, R, T, or Y), a special keyboard key (like SPACE, CLICK, RIGHT CLICK, ENTER, BACKSPACE, SHIFT, TAB, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, or WINDOWS), or a joypad button (JOY1, JOY2, JOY3, to JOY16).

If you want to use JOY9 through JOY16 you need to reconfigure vJoy. Search for vJoyConf in your start menu and set buttons to 16.

Alternatively, you can disable a key by binding it to NONE,

Throttle controls the delay between checking for new packets (in milliseconds), a high number will have slightly more lag between pressing a button on the 3DS and receiving it on the PC, however will make the application use less CPU. In my experience, 20 is a reasonable throttling amount,

vJoy Device chooses which device to connect to. Set this to 2 in a second instance of 3DSController to use a second 3DS at the same time, perhaps for multiplayer.

Make sure to use a single space, not a tab for seperating settings,
